# berlin-streetnames

Shows if a street is named after a man or a woman. A blue line means it is named after a man, a red line after a woman.
If the line is grey no information could be found.

This is the sister project of [streetnames-berlin](https://github.com/k-nut/streetnames-berlin/) which tries to determine the
gender based only on the data in osm.

This project takes a slightly different approach and uses the exisiting explanation texts in the German Wikipedia (c.f. https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Stra%C3%9Fen_und_Pl%C3%A4tze_in_Berlin-Friedrichshain). Those were scraped by [tursics](https://github.com/tursics) and their gender was determined with wikidata once more.
